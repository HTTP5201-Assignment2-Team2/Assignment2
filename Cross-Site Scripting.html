    <h1>Cross-Site Scripting XSS</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping,
        or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows 
        attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user 
        to malicious sites.
    </p>
 
    <h2>There are three forms of XSS, usually targeting users’ browsers:</h2>
    <h3>Reflected XSS:</h3>
    <p>
        The application or API includes unvalidated and unescaped user input as part of HTML output.
        A successful attack can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript in the victim’s browser. 
        Typically the user will need to interact with some malicious link that points to an attacker-controlled page,
        such as malicious watering hole websites, advertisements, or similar.
    </p>

    <h3>Stored XSS:</h3>
    <p>
        The application or API stores unsanitized user input that is viewed at a later time by another user or an administrator. 
        Stored XSS is often considered a high or critical risk.
    </p>

    
    <h3> DOM XSS:</h3>
    <p>
        avaScript frameworks, single-page applications, and APIs that dynamically include attacker-controllable data to a page are vulnerable to DOM XSS. Ideally, 
        the application would not send attacker-controllable data to unsafe JavaScript APIs.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Prevent XSS Attacks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Using frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design, such as the latest Ruby on Rails, React JS.
            Learn the limitations of each framework’s XSS protection and appropriately handle the use cases which are not covered.</li>

        <li>Applying context-sensitive encoding when modifying the browser document on the client side acts against DOM XSS. </li>
        <li>Enabling a Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth mitigating control against XSS. 
            It is effective if no other vulnerabilities exist that would allow placing malicious code via local file includes 
            (e.g. path traversal overwrites or vulnerable libraries from permitted content delivery networks).</li>

    <h2>Summary - Our Understanding</h2>
    <p>
        Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications.
        XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users and steal the private sensitive informations.
        The attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser of the victim by including malicious code in a web page or web application.
        The actual attack occurs when the victim visits the web page or web application that executes the malicious code and it becomes a vehicle
        to deliver the malicious script to the user’s browser.
