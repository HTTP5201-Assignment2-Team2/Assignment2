    <h1>Insecure Deserialization</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code 
        execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.
    </p>

    <h2> Two Primary Types of Attacks</h2>
    <h2>Object and data structure related attacks</h2>
    <p>
        Where the attacker modifies application logic or achieves arbitrary remote code execution 
        if there are classes available to the application that can change behavior during or after deserialization.
    </p>

    <h2>Typical data tampering attacks</h2>
    <p>
        Typical data tampering attacks such as access-control-related attacks where existing data structures are used but the content is changed.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary - Our Understanding</h2>
    <p>
        Serialization is the process that converts an object to a format that can later be restored.
        Deserialization is the opposing process which takes data from a file, stream or network and rebuilds it into an object. 
        Insecure deserialization is a vulnerability in which an untrusted or unknown data is used to either inflict a denial of service attack (DoS attack),
        execute code, bypass authentication or further abuse the logic behind an application.
