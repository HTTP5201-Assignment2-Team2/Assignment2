    <h1>Broken Access Control</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents.
         External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares,
          internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.
    </p>


    <h2>Summary - Our Understanding</h2>
    <p>
        Broke access control has been considered as one of the major security risks. The reason for this is because exploitation of access
        control is a core skill of attackers. Once they have found a way to gain access of the server,  they can make changes to every record of the server as a
        user or administrator. The best way to detect access controls from attackers is to perform manual testing to detect missing or ineffective
        access control.
