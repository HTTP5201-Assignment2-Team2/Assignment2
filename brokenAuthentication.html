    <h1>Broken Authentication</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities temporarily or permanently.    </p>

    <h2>Summary - Our Understanding</h2>
    <p>
        Application faces this of issues generally when atackers have access to milllons records of username and password combination. This is achieve through broken links or id are being send as a part of URL. Also sometimes
        if the password coomn such as 'Password1' or they are not chnaged for long time. To prevent this , we implement mutltifacotr authentication and passwords are encrypted correctly.
