    <h1>Injection</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization
    </p>

    <h2>Summary - Our Understanding</h2>
    <p>
        Injection mainly occurs when data is being sent , to database such as SQL, NoSQL , XML. Generally , this occurs when a select query with id is being executed , so here id can be changed.
        Also this can be prevented by sanitizing the application or by adding some software before sending the data.
