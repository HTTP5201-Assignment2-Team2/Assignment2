            <p>Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident
                response,
                allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper,
                extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically
                detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring.

                        every major incident.
                        Attackers rely on the lack of monitoring and timely response to achieve their goals without
                        being detected.</p>

                        One strategy for determining if you have sufficient monitoring is to examine the logs following
                        penetration testing. The testers’ actions should be recorded sufficiently to understand what
                        damages they may have inflicted

                    <p class="text-left">Most successful attacks start with vulnerability probing. Allowing such probes
                        to continue can raise the likelihood of successful exploit to nearly 100%.</p>
                    <p>In 2016, identifying a breach took an average of 191 days – plenty of time for damage to be
                        inflicted.</p>

                        Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring and active response occurs any time:
                        <p>* Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions are not
                            logged.</p>
                        <p>* Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages.</p>
                        <p>* Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity.</p>
                        <p>* Logs are only stored locally.</p>
                        <p>* Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>* Penetration testing and scans by DAST tools (such as OWASP ZAP) do not trigger alerts.</p>
                        <p>* The application is unable to detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real time or
                            near real time.</p>
                        <p>You are vulnerable to information leakage if you make logging and alerting events visible to
                            a user or an attacker
                            (see A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure).</p>

                    <h3>How to prevent</h3>
                    <div class="text-left">
                        As per the risk of the data stored or processed by the application:
                        <p>* Ensure all login, access control failures, and server-side input validation failures can be
                            logged with sufficient user context to identify suspicious or malicious accounts, and held
                            for sufficient time to allow delayed forensic analysis.</p>
                        <p>* Ensure that logs are generated in a format that can be easily consumed by a centralized log
                            management solutions.</p>
                        <p>* Ensure high-value transactions have an audit trail with integrity controls to prevent
                            tampering or deletion, such as append-only database tables or similar.</p>
                        <p>* Establish effective monitoring and alerting such that suspicious activities are detected
                            and responded to in a timely fashion.</p>
                        <p>* Establish or adopt an incident response and recovery plan, such as NIST 800-61 rev 2 or
                            later.</p>
                        <p>There are commercial and open source application protection frameworks such as OWASP
                            AppSensor (old wiki), web application firewalls such as ModSecurity with the OWASP
                            ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and log correlation software with custom dashboards and alerting.

                    <h3>Example Attack Scenarios</h3>
                    <div class="text-left">
                        <p><b>Scenario #1:</b> An open source project forum software run by a small team was
                            hacked using a flaw in its software. The attackers managed to wipe out the internal source
                            code repository containing the next version, and all of the forum contents. Although source
                            could be recovered, the lack of monitoring, logging or alerting led to a far worse breach.
                            The forum software project is no longer active as a result of this issue.</p>
                        <p><b>Scenario #2:</b> An attacker uses scans for users using a common password. They can take
                            over
                            all accounts using this password. For all other users, this scan leaves only one false login
                            behind. After some days, this may be repeated with a different password.</p>
                        <p><b>Scenario #3:</b> A major US retailer reportedly had an internal malware analysis sandbox
                            analyzing attachments. The sandbox software had detected potentially unwanted software, but
                            no one responded to this detection. The sandbox had been producing warnings for some time
                            before the breach was detected due to fraudulent card transactions by an external bank.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p class="text-left">
                        In conclusion it can be said the inefficient logging and monitoring can lead to a major loss in
                        the organisation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left">
                        That is why the practice of maintaining a proper user log is being opted at every level.
                        Maintaining effective user log and keeping track of all the system activites helps not only in
                        prevention of data loss but also keeps system less vulnerable to any upcoming threat.
