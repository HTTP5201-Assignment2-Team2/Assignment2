        <p>When browsing through an unsafe resource, most often ours system warns us about the vulnerability of the
            resource and
            the harm that may be caused to the system.Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software
            modules, run
            with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can
            facilitate serious
            data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may
            undermine application
            defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.

                        vulnerabilities,

                    <p class="text-left">Prevalence of this issue is very widespread. Component-heavy development
                        patterns can lead to
                        development
                        teams not even understanding which components they use in their application or API, much less
                        keeping them

                        Some scanners such as retire.js help in detection, but determining exploitability requires
                        additional effort.

                        have relied
                        on exploiting known vulnerabilities in components. Depending on the assets you are protecting,
                        perhaps this risk

                    <h3>Is the application vulnerable</h3>
                    <div class="text-left">
                        You are likely vulnerable:
                        <p>* If you do not know the versions of all components you use (both client-side and
                            server-side). This includes components you directly use as well as nested dependencies.</p>
                        <p>* If software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. This includes the OS,
                            web/application server, database management system (DBMS), applications, APIs and all
                            components, runtime environments, and libraries.</p>
                        <p>* If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to security bulletins
                            related to the components you use.</p>
                        <p>* If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks, and dependencies in a
                            risk-based, timely fashion. This commonly happens in environments when patching is a monthly
                            or quarterly task under change control, which leaves organizations open to many days or
                            months of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p>* If software developers do not test the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched
                            libraries.</p>
                        <p>* If you do not secure the componentsâ€™ configurations (see A6:2017-Security
                            Misconfiguration).</p>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h3>How to prevent</h3>
                    <div class="text-left">
                        There should be a patch management process in place to:
                        <p>* Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.</p>
                        <p>* Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components (e.g.
                            frameworks, libraries) and their dependencies using tools like versions, DependencyCheck,
                            retire.js, etc. Continuously monitor sources like CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities in the
                            components. Use software composition analysis tools to automate the process. Subscribe to
                            email alerts for security vulnerabilities related to components you use.</p>
                        <p>* Only obtain components from official sources over secure links. Prefer signed packages to
                            reduce the chance of including a modified, malicious component.</p>
                        <p>* If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks, and dependencies in a
                            risk-based, timely fashion. This commonly happens in environments when patching is a monthly
                            or quarterly task under change control, which leaves organizations open to many days or
                            months of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p>* Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not create security
                            patches for older versions. If patching is not possible, consider deploying a virtual patch
                            to monitor, detect, or protect against the discovered issue.</p>
                        <p>Every organization must ensure that there is an ongoing plan for monitoring, triaging, and
                            applying updates or configuration changes for the lifetime of the application or portfolio.

                    <h3>Example Attack Scenarios</h3>
                    <div class="text-left">
                        <p>Scenario #1: Components typically run with the same privileges as the application itself, so
                            flaws in any component can result in serious impact. Such flaws can be accidental (e.g.
                            coding error) or intentional (e.g. backdoor in component). Some example exploitable
                            component vulnerabilities discovered are:</p>
                        <p>* CVE-2017-5638, a Struts 2 remote code execution vulnerability that enables execution of
                            arbitrary code on the server, has been blamed for significant breaches.</p>
                        <p>* While internet of things (IoT) are frequently difficult or impossible to patch, the
                            importance of patching them can be great (e.g. biomedical devices).</p>
                        <p>There are automated tools to help attackers find unpatched or misconfigured systems. For
                            example, the Shodan IoT search engine can help you find devices that still suffer from
                            Heartbleed vulnerability that was patched in April 2014.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">
                        In order to run system smoothly organisations come up with their own vulnerability patches that prevents
                        system from being vulnerable. Manufacturers in the same way take care of any vulnerability in thier own way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left">
                            The same way we can also protect our system from external vulnerabilities by trying some important practices as follows.

                                <li>By continuously updating the system.</li>
                                <li>By formatting the system once in a while.</li>
