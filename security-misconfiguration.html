    <h1>Security Misconfiguration</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations,
        incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing
        sensitive information. Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured,
        but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.
    </p>


    <h2>Summary - Our Understanding</h2>
    <p>
        Security Misconfiguration has been considered as one of the major security risks. The reason for this is because attackers are
        able to exploit the flaws of insecure default or incomplete configurations of servers or services. The flaws can allow attackers to access
        the servers. Automated scanners are really useful to detect and vertify any misconfiguration of servers, accounts, or services.
